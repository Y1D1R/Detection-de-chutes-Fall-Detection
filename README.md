# Elderly Fall Detection Application

Welcome! 

This project was developed as part of a final year project for a bachelor's degree. The main objective of this application is to utilize computer vision to detect falls of elderly individuals using videos provided by home surveillance cameras.
## Overview

The aging population in Algeria is steadily increasing, with individuals over 65 years old representing a significant portion of the population. Falls are one of the major issues faced by the elderly. The consequences of falls can be severe, leading to hospitalizations or even deaths.

In this context, this application employs computer vision to continuously monitor videos from surveillance cameras installed in the homes of elderly individuals. It detects potential falls and sends alerts to ensure their safety.
Features

- Fall detection from surveillance videos.

- Utilization of computer vision techniques to analyze movements.

- Alert notifications upon fall detection.

## Usage

- Run the "main.exe" file located in the Application/ folder.

- You can view the main code of the method used in the "code_main.py" file.

## Technologies Used

- Computer vision, Image and video processing.
- Python, OpenCV and PyQt for the GUI.
